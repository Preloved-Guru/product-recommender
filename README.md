# Product Recommender

This project connects to a PostgreSQL product database and recommends products based on:
- Gender
- Size
- Width
- Brand/Model
- Color preferences

## Usage

1. Put your DB config into `config.py` (not tracked by git).
2. Run `test_script.py` to test the recommendation logic.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_script.py
